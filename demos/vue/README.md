# riba-vue-example

This demo demonstrates how you can use Vue.js in Riba.
Yes you heard right, it is possible to use Vue.js within Riba.js.

## How it works

The component src/ts/components/vue-example/vue-example.component.ts creates a Vue app, inside this component (which is a custom element) you can use all the Vue.js features you love. It is also possible to have multiple components like this. Outside of this component you can use Riba.js.

# Try it out

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ribajs/riba.git
cd riba/demos/vue
npm install
npm run start
```
